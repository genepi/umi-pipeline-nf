This folder contains test data to run the pipeline from a proof-of-principle run.
The test data originated from mixtures of two plasmids containing different sequences (KIV-2A or KIV-2B).

Barcode02:
Raw reads: 10,336
Found clusters: 1,383
Clusters equal or above the minimal cluster size (18): 30
Clusters equal or above the minimal cluster size (18) after read balancing: 14
Consensus sequences before polishing: 14
Final consensus sequences after polishing: 13
1 Sequence KIV-2B can be found in both (consensus and final) bam files.

Barocde03:
Barcode03 has a mixture level of 33% KIV-2A and 67% KIV-2B.
Raw reads: 6,509
Found clusters: 240
Clusters equal or above the minimal cluster size (18): 104
Clusters equal or above the minimal cluster size (18) after read balancing: 14
Consensus sequences before polishing: 91
Final consensus sequences after polishing: 76
51 Sequence KIV-2B can be found in both (consensus and final) bam files.
